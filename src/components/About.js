          <p>This is a track and race generator for the{' '}
            <a href="http://www.liftoff-game.com/">LiftOff Quadcopter Racing
            flight simulator</a>.</p>

          <p>You add points that are connected by a quadratic curve of which
            you can choose the slope of. In the first step you can add as many
            points as you like. When you are done, click <i>Close Track</i> to
            process to the second step of track generation: Track width
            settings, Marker and Gate placement and finally <strong>Track and
            Race generation</strong>.</p>

          <p>The app will generate XML for the track and for the race if you
            chose so. The results simply need to be copied to your LiftOff
            Track and Race directories.</p>

          <p>Due to the nature of drawing on a canvas of fixed size, this might
